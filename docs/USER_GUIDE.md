# Hire Gnome ATS User Guide

This guide is for day-to-day users. It explains the core workflow and how each module fits together.

## 1) Core Workflow

Use this sequence as your default process:

1. Create or update a `Client`.
2. Create or update a `Contact` for that client.
3. Create a `Job Order` linked to the client and hiring manager contact.
4. Add or import a `Candidate`.
5. Create a `Submission` for candidate + job order.
6. Share the `Client Review Portal` from the job order when you want external client feedback without requiring client login.
7. Schedule one or more `Interviews`.
8. Convert successful submissions to `Placements`.
9. Use notes, activities, and administrator audit trail access for accountability where applicable.

## 2) Roles And Access

### Administrator
- Full access across all divisions.
- Can manage users, divisions, system settings, billing, and diagnostics.
- Diagnostics also surfaces recent inbound email webhook events for troubleshooting.
- Can reassign owners and divisions.

### Director
- Access to all records in their division.
- Can assign ownership to recruiters in the same division.

### Recruiter
- Access is controlled by division mode:
- `Collaborative` division: sees all records in that division.
- `Owner Only` division: sees records they own (plus records explicitly linked by workflow).
- Reporting is stricter: recruiters only see their own data in the `Reports` module.

## 3) Navigation Basics

- Left navigation: module list.
- Top search: global search across records.
- User menu (`top-right`): account settings, Help, and sign out.
- List pages: search, filters, sorting, paging, and column chooser.
- Detail pages: snapshot at top, editable form, workspace tabs for related records.
- Actions menu (`...`): context actions like archive, close, cancel, convert, and administrator-only audit access where supported.

## Demo Environment Note

If you are using the public demo environment, the first authenticated login shows a one-time modal with quick guidance.

Important demo-specific behavior:
- Demo data is preloaded so you can move directly through candidate, job order, submission, interview, and placement flows.
- Demo data resets periodically.
- Forwarding an email to `demo@hiregnome.com` triggers the inbound Postmark workflow.
- The forwarded message must contain an email address that matches an existing candidate or contact record.
- When it matches, Hire Gnome creates an email note on that record.
- Candidate matches can also receive file attachments from the inbound message.

## 4) Required Field Behavior

- Required fields show a red `*`.
- Save buttons stay disabled until required fields are valid.
- Email and URL fields are validated.
- Phone and currency fields auto-format while typing.
- Zip-based city/state inference is applied where configured.
- AI features show a disabled control plus a hint when OpenAI has not been configured in `Admin Area > System Settings`.

## 5) Module Guides

## Inbound Email Capture

Primary purpose:
- Turn inbound recruiting emails into structured candidate/contact history.

Behavior:
1. Postmark sends inbound email JSON to `/api/inbound/postmark`.
2. The system extracts email addresses from the payload.
3. If a `Candidate.email` or `Contact.email` matches, the system creates an `Email` note on that record.
4. Candidate matches can also receive file attachments from the inbound email.
5. Contact matches currently receive notes only, not file attachments.

What users will see:
- On candidate and contact detail views, inbound emails appear in Notes with `Email` note type styling.
- The note body is cleaned up to remove most forwarded-header junk, external caution banners, and quoted thread noise.
- On candidates, supported inbound attachments appear in the Files area when the email payload includes real attachment content.

Admin troubleshooting:
- `Admin Area > System Settings > System Diagnostics` shows recent inbound email events, match counts, notes created, files saved, and attachment skip reasons.

## Candidates

Primary purpose:
- Store candidate profile, resume, skills, history, and activity.

Common actions:
1. `Candidates > New Candidate`
2. Fill required identity fields.
3. Add status, source, owner, and current employment details.
4. Add notes, education, work history, and file attachments.
5. Use the candidate detail sparkles `AI Summary` header button to open the summary modal. If no summary exists yet, it generates automatically.
6. Use the candidate detail snapshot card to quickly review title, location, status, top skills, AI summary snippet, last activity, and profile completeness before submission.
7. Use `Actions` for fast create:
- Add submission
- Add interview
- Add placement
- Draft email

Resume parsing:
- Choose upload or paste mode.
- System attempts AI parsing first if key is configured.
- Falls back to built-in parser if AI is unavailable.
- Parsed resumes can auto-populate candidate data and attach source file.
- In the candidate `Files` workspace, uploaded files can be labeled as the candidate's `Resume` for clearer internal review and to control which resume is exposed in the client portal.

AI summary:
- Opened from the candidate detail sparkles `AI Summary` header button.
- Generated on demand from the candidate profile, resume text, skills, education, work history, and recent notes.
- Opening the modal auto-generates the first summary when none exists.
- Stored separately from the resume field.
- Shows:
	- overview
	- strengths
	- concerns
	- suggested next step
- Can be refreshed from the modal.
- Matched job orders also support `Explain Match`, which stores a reusable explanation of fit, likely gaps, and what the recruiter should validate.

Profile completeness:
- Shown in the candidate snapshot card.
- Uses existing profile data to score recruiter readiness.
- Highlights top missing profile gaps like resume summary, skills, work history, education, resume attachment, and required custom fields.
- Also appears as a compact score chip on the candidates list.
- Creating a submission from a low-completeness candidate shows a soft warning, but does not hard-block the workflow.

Duplicate handling:
- Candidate creation includes duplicate checks.
- Merge option is available when duplicate confidence is high.

Email drafting:
- Candidate actions include `Draft Email`.
- Choose purpose and tone, optionally add instructions, then generate a reusable draft.
- Copy the generated subject/body directly to the clipboard.
- If OpenAI is not configured, the action stays visible but disabled with a hint.

## Clients

Primary purpose:
- Track companies, ownership, status, and client-level notes/activity.

Common actions:
1. `Clients > New Client`

Common actions:
1. `Contacts > New Contact`
2. Complete required fields:
- Name
- Email
- Mobile
- Source
- Owner
- Client
3. Add title, department, address, and notes.

Behavior notes:
- When creating from a client route, client is locked.
- For existing contact records, client is not editable.
- Contact actions include `Draft Email` for recruiter-facing outbound draft generation.
- If OpenAI is not configured, the action stays visible but disabled with a hint.

## Job Orders

Primary purpose:
- Define open requisitions and required qualifications.

2. Set required owner, status, client, and hiring manager contact.
3. Add internal description.
4. If career-site posting is enabled:

Submission workflow:
- Add submissions directly from job order detail workspace.
- Use `Priority Order` in the submissions workspace to rank submissions by recruiter preference.
- Drag and drop submissions while in `Priority Order` sort to persist the ranking.
- Candidate names in the submissions workspace open the candidate record; use the separate launch icon to open the submission record.
- The submissions workspace shows the latest client portal action/comment on each submission row for quick review.
- Career-site responses stay marked as `Web` and start hidden from the client portal until a recruiter promotes them from submission detail.
- Duplicate submissions for same candidate + job are blocked.
- Candidate suggestions use qualification scoring and typeahead safeguards.
- Candidate matches support `Explain Match`, which opens a saved AI explanation for why a candidate fits, where the gaps are, and what to validate before submitting.
- Use `Actions > Client Review Portal` to create, copy, email, open, revoke, or restore the persistent client-facing magic link for the assigned hiring contact, with portal analytics on job order detail and in the modal showing sent, opened, last viewed, and acted-on status.

## Submissions

Primary purpose:
- Track candidate delivery to job orders.

Common actions:
1. Create submission from candidate or job order flow.
2. Update status through lifecycle.
3. Use the `Client Write-Up` toolbar icons to generate or copy the AI write-up.
4. Use actions menu for:

- Schedule interview

Behavior notes:
- Candidate/job become locked after creation.
- If converted to placement, submission becomes non-editable.
- `Client Write-Up` can be AI-generated from the candidate and job order, then edited before saving.
- The write-up toolbar sits above the field and supports regenerate + copy to clipboard.
- `Client Feedback` on submission detail shows comments and actions received through the client review portal, including interview requests and passes.
- If the client uses `Pass`, the portal confirms the action first and then locks that submission against any further client responses.
- Client `Pass` actions also move that submission to the bottom of the job order's `Priority Order` ranking.
- The client portal only exposes the candidate's labeled primary resume. If no primary resume is set, the portal does not offer a file download.
- Submission detail includes a `Client Portal` visibility field plus actions to `Promote to Client Portal` or `Hide from Client Portal`.
